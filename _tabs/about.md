Hi, I’m Anqi Kang, though I prefer to go by Kai Kang. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Information Systems from [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/) in the United States.

My journey into technology is anything but conventional — I started as a Sneaker Custom Artist before transitioning into Software Engineering. This creative background has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving, allowing me to blend artistry with technical expertise. From designing personalized artwork to developing innovative software solutions, I’ve cultivated a strong skill set in creative problem-solving, effective communication, and collaborative teamwork.

As a Software Engineer, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and crafting impactful solutions. My artistic roots inspire me to think outside the box, while my technical training ensures I build scalable and efficient systems. I’m continuously honing my skills, staying ahead of emerging tech trends, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaikangsde/)!

Hi, I’m **Anqi Kang**, though I prefer to go by **Kai Kang**. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Information Systems from [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/).

As a former Sneaker Custom Artist turned Software Engineer, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving by blending creativity with technical expertise. My journey from designing personalized art to developing innovative software solutions has equipped me with a diverse skill set, including effective communication, project organization, and collaborative teamwork.

Transitioning into the tech industry, I’ve embraced the challenge of building meaningful experiences through technology. My artistic background fosters a creative approach to tackling complex problems, while my technical training ensures precise, scalable solutions.

Currently, I am thriving as a Software Engineer, continuously honing my skills and staying ahead of emerging trends in technology. With a passion for learning and innovation, I am dedicated to delivering impactful projects that drive results and create value for users.

Learning! Keep learning! Relearning! 

I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaikangsde/)!

# LeetCode 

Link: [876 - Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/description/)

**key points:**
- **Two-Pointer**
    - slow: moves one step at a time
    - fast: moves two steps at a time
    - By the time fast reaches the end of the list, slow will be at the middle.
- **fast != null && fast.next != null**
    - Ensures fast.next.next wonâ€™t be called unless fast.next is valid.
    - Allows handling both odd and even-length lists gracefully.


## Complexity
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity(excluding output): O(1)


## Jave

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return null;
        }

        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
}
```

## Python

```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None
        
        fast, slow = head, head

        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        return slow
```

## JavaScript

```javascript
var middleNode = function(head) {
    if (!head) return null;

    let fast = head;
    let slow = head;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        slow = slow.next;
    }    
    return slow;
};
```

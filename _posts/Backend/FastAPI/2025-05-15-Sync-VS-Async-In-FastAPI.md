# üöÄ Sync vs Async in FastAPI
Understanding the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** code can be tricky. So let‚Äôs simplify it using a real-life analogy: **ordering bubble tea**!

## ü§ù Synchronous (Sync) ‚Äì Traditional Bubble Tea Shop

### Scenario

You walk into a traditional milk tea shop:

1. **You:** "I'd like a pearl milk tea."
2. **Clerk:** Starts making it (takes 5 minutes).
3. **You:** Wait and do nothing.
4. **Clerk:** "Here you go!"
5. **Next customer:** Still waiting in line.

### Key Characteristics

- Tasks are processed **one at a time**.
- Each operation **blocks** the next.
- If something takes 5 seconds, nothing else happens during that time.


## üëèüèª Asynchronous (Async) ‚Äì Smart Bubble Tea Shop

### Scenario

You visit a smart, self-service milk tea shop:

1. **You:** Place an order via app.
2. **System:** Accepts the order and assigns a number.
3. **You:** Sit and scroll your phone.
4. **Clerk:** Makes multiple drinks in parallel.
5. **System:** Notifies you when your drink is ready.

### Key Characteristics

- Tasks can run **concurrently**.
- While waiting, other things **keep happening**.
- Ideal for I/O-bound operations (like waiting for a database, API, etc.)


## üîÅ Sync vs Async in FastAPI: Key Differences with Code
For I/O-heavy APIs (like external HTTP requests), asynchronous FastAPI endpoints drastically reduce response time and improve throughput ‚Äî a must-have for production-grade performance.

### Synchronous Version (Slower, Blocking)
In a synchronous function, **each request waits for the previous one to finish** ‚Äî even if they are independent.

```python
import requests
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/sync-news")
def get_news_sync():
    # Sequential calls: total time = 2s + 2s = 4s
    news1 = requests.get("https://api1.com").json()  # ‚è≥ 2s
    news2 = requests.get("https://api2.com").json()  # ‚è≥ 2s
    return {"total_time": 4}
```

### Asynchronous Version (Faster, Concurrent)
With httpx.AsyncClient and asyncio.gather, the two requests `run in parallel`.

```python
import httpx
import asyncio
import time
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/async-news")
async def get_news_async():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        start = time.time()
        task1 = client.get("https://api1.com")  # üëà Starts both
        task2 = client.get("https://api2.com")
        res1, res2 = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)  # üëà Awaits both
        elapsed = time.time() - start
        return {
            "total_time": round(elapsed, 2),  # ‚âà 2 seconds (not 4!)
            "news1": res1.json(),
            "news2": res2.json()
        }
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Async Programming in Python with `asyncio`
Python‚Äôs built-in `asyncio` library is the foundation for **asynchronous programming**, enabling high-concurrency applications with minimal thread usage.

The **core concepts** of `asyncio`, including **coroutines**, **event loops**, **tasks**, and **futures**.


### Why Async?

Traditional (synchronous) code blocks the program while waiting for I/O ‚Äî e.g., network, disk, or database. This **limits throughput**.

With `asyncio`, you can **suspend** operations using `await`, freeing the event loop to do other work.

> _Ideal for I/O-bound scenarios like web services, crawlers, bots, and API clients._


### 1. Coroutine
A coroutine is a special function defined using `async def`. It returns a coroutine object and doesn't execute until `await`ed or scheduled.

When a coroutine encounters `await some_async_operation()`, two things happen:

1. The **coroutine is suspended** ‚Äî it *pauses execution* at that line.
2. The **event loop regains control** and is free to run **other tasks**.

Once the awaited operation is finished (e.g., HTTP response arrives, file read completes), the coroutine is **resumed right where it left off**.


```python
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Done!")
```

### 2. Event Loop
In Python's asynchronous programming model, the **event loop** is the **orchestrator** of everything. It runs your coroutines, handles I/O events, manages timers, and makes sure tasks get scheduled and executed.

If you're writing `async` code in Python, you're working **with** (and **inside**) the event loop ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt see it directly.

The **event loop** is:

- A continuously running process
- That **watches for completed I/O operations**
- And **dispatches control** back to the appropriate coroutine

It‚Äôs the core engine behind libraries like `asyncio`, `FastAPI`, `httpx`, and more.
```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # wait 1 second -> During the pause, the event loop can run other coroutines.
    print("...World!")

# Start the event loop and run coroutine
asyncio.run(say_hello())
```

#### Under the Hood
- When you call: `asyncio.run(say_hello())`
- **It does the following:**
    1.	Creates an event loop
	2.	Wraps your coroutine as a Task
	3.	Runs the event loop until the Task finishes
	4.	Cleans up the loop
- You could also manually manage the loop: (**use asyncio.run() in most cases.**)
    ```python
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    loop.run_until_complete(my_coroutine())
    loop.close()
    ```

#### Event Loop FLow

```text
Coroutine A starts
‚Üì
await async_task() ‚Üí yields control
‚Üì
Event loop picks Coroutine B
‚Üì
B does work ‚Üí await other_task()
‚Üì
A's task completes ‚Üí resumed by event loop
```

### 3. Task
In asynchronous Python programming, a **Task** is a wrapper around a coroutine that lets it run **concurrently** within the event loop.

Unlike a plain coroutine, a Task is **scheduled for execution** immediately and can run alongside other tasks ‚Äî perfect for high-performance I/O operations.

- A **Task** is created from a coroutine using `asyncio.create_task()`
- It is then **scheduled** by the event loop
- The task will run **asynchronously**, allowing other tasks to run concurrently

```python
import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    print("Start working...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Finished!")

async def main():
    # Create a task from the coroutine
    task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())

    print("Task started... doing other work")
    await task
    print("Task finished")

asyncio.run(main())

# Task started... doing other work
# Start working...
# (wait 2 seconds)
# Finished!
# Task finished
```

- The event loop schedules my_coroutine() as a Task
- Meanwhile, main() continues execution until await task is called


### 4. Future
In Python‚Äôs `asyncio` framework, a **Future** represents a placeholder for a result that **doesn‚Äôt exist yet**, but will be available in the future. It's the low-level building block for managing asynchronous operations.

A `Future` object acts as a container for the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

- It's **not a coroutine**.
- It is **used internally by the event loop** to track tasks.
- You don‚Äôt `await` a `Future` directly in most application code.
- Instead, it‚Äôs usually **wrapped by a `Task`**, which is a higher-level construct.

```python
import asyncio

async def set_future(fut):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    fut.set_result("Future is done!")

async def main():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    fut = loop.create_future() # creates an empty Future.

    asyncio.create_task(set_future(fut))
    result = await fut
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

- In **most real-world scenarios**, developers use Task instead of manually dealing with Future.
- A Task is a subclass of Future that wraps coroutines and integrates with the event loop automatically.


## üåê Modern HTTP Requests in Python with `httpx`
In modern Python web development, efficient HTTP communication is key. [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) is a **powerful, modern alternative to `requests`**, supporting both **sync** and **async** usage out of the box ‚Äî with built-in **HTTP/2**, timeout management, streaming, and connection pooling.

- **Installation**: `pip install httpx`

### Why Use `httpx`?

| Feature               | Description                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sync & Async        | Unified API for both synchronous and asynchronous use |
| HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2   | Supports modern HTTP protocols                    |
| Secure & Fast       | Built-in timeout, retry, and connection pool support |
| Testing             | Native test client with mock server support      |


### Synchronous Request Example
-  Simple syntax, just like requests, but with better performance and modern support.

```python
import httpx

response = httpx.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
```

### Asynchronous Request Example
- Use httpx.AsyncClient() to perform fully non-blocking HTTP operations in async workflows.

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
        print(response.json())

asyncio.run(fetch_data())
```

### Recommended: Use a Client Instance
Using **a client instance** provides:
- Connection reuse (better performance)
- Timeout, retry, and base URL management

- **Synchronous Client:**
    ```python
    with httpx.Client() as client:
        response = client.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
        print(response.json())
    ```

- **Asynchronous Client:**
    ```python
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
        print(response.json())
    ```



## üßµ Examples

###  Synchronous Endpoint (Blocking)

**Behavior**:
- The time.sleep(3) blocks the entire event loop/thread.
- No other request can be processed during this time (if running in a single worker).
- Suitable for CPU-bound or small-scale applications.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import time

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/sync_func")
def sync_endpoint():
    print("Task 1 starts")     # Immediate execution
    time.sleep(3)              # Blocks the thread for 3 seconds
    print("Task 2 starts")     # Executes after blocking
    return {"status": "done"}
```


### Asynchronous Endpoint (Non-Blocking)

**Behavior**:
- await asyncio.sleep(3) yields control back to the event loop.
- While waiting, FastAPI can serve other incoming requests.
- Best for I/O-bound operations: DB queries, HTTP calls, file access

```python
import asyncio

@app.get("/async_func")
async def async_endpoint():
    print("Task A starts")         # Immediate
    await asyncio.sleep(3)         # Non-blocking wait
    print("Task B starts")         # Resumes after 3 seconds
    return {"status": "done"}
```


### Concurrent External API Calls in FastAPI

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime
import httpx
import time
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

# Async HTTP GET requester
async def fetch_data(url: str):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        return response.json()

@app.get("/test1")
async def test1():
    print(f"test1 start at {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S.%f')}")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  
    print(f"test1 end at {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S.%f')}")
    return {"status": "done"}

@app.get("/test2")
async def test2():
    print(f"test2 start at {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S.%f')}")
    await asyncio.sleep(4)  
    print(f"test2 end at {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S.%f')}")
    return {"status": "done"}

# FastAPI route that concurrently fetches data from multiple URLs
@app.get("/kkblogs")
async def get_news():
    print("kkblogs")
    start = time.time()

    urls = [
        "https://api-v2.xdclass.net/api/funny/v1/get_funny",
        "https://api-v2.xdclass.net/api/banner/v1/list?location=home_top_ad",
        "https://api-v2.xdclass.net/api/rank/v1/hot_product",
        "http://localhost:8000/test1",
        "http://localhost:8000/test2",
    ]

    # Create coroutine tasks for all URLs
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]

    # Run all tasks concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    print(f"‚è±Ô∏è Total elapsed time: {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds")
    return results

# kkblogs
# test1 start at 08:24:10.109683
# test2 start at 08:24:10.109961
# test1 end at 08:24:13.110744
# INFO:     127.0.0.1:57615 - "GET /test1 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
# test2 end at 08:24:14.111182
# INFO:     127.0.0.1:57618 - "GET /test2 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
# ‚è±Ô∏è Total elapsed time: 4.05 seconds
# INFO:     127.0.0.1:57611 - "GET /kkblogs HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

## ‚ùó Common Mistake: Blocking Calls in Async FastAPI Routes

```python
import time
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

#  Incorrect usage: time.sleep() blocks the entire event loop
@app.get("/wrong")
async def bad_example():
    time.sleep(5)  # Blocks the event loop, degrades performance
    return {"error": "This blocks everything!"}
```

- time.sleep() is a synchronous function.
- When called inside an async route, it blocks the entire event loop, causing other concurrent tasks to hang.
- This defeats the purpose of using async in the first place!

### Correct Usage: Use Asynchronous Alternatives

```python
import asyncio

# Correct: Use asyncio.sleep to avoid blocking
@app.get("/right1")
async def good_example():
    await asyncio.sleep(5)  #  Non-blocking sleep
    return {"status": "Async sleep completed"}
```
- await asyncio.sleep() is non-blocking.
- It yields control back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run during the wait time.
- Perfect for I/O-bound wait operations like API calls, DB access, or throttling delays.


## ‚úÖ FastAPI Routing & Performance Best Practices

### When You **Must Use `async def`**
Use `async def` routes when your logic involves **non-blocking I/O** or **concurrent tasks**:
1. Calling async libraries with `await`
2. WebSocket communication
3. Long-running background tasks

### When It‚Äôs Better to Use def (Synchronous)
Not everything needs to be async. In fact, using async unnecessarily can slow things down or complicate the code.

Use synchronous def routes when:
1. Performing pure CPU-bound computations
2. Using synchronous database drivers
3. Fast-return endpoints

### Performance Optimization Tips
1. Keep async def routes lightweight
- Avoid CPU-heavy work inside async routes
- Use await for real async I/O (e.g., httpx, asyncpg)

2. Offload Long-Running CPU Tasks
- Use threads or process pools for heavy synchronous operations.

3. Use Connection Pools
- Use HTTP connection pools with httpx.AsyncClient
- Use database connection pooling (e.g., with Databases or SQLAlchemy async)

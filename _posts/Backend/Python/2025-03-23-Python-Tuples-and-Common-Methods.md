# 🚀 Python Tuples (tuple) and Common Methods
A **tuple** is an **immutable sequence type** in Python, meaning its content **cannot be changed once created**. Tuples are commonly used in **read-only or fixed data** scenarios.
- **Immutability** —> Tuples themselves cannot be changed after creation. However, if a tuple contains mutable elements (like lists), those internal elements can still be modified without changing the overall tuple structure.
- **Ordered** -> Tuples preserve the order in which elements are added, so you can access elements by their index.
- **Allow Duplicates** -> Tuples can contain repeated values, unlike sets.
- **Parentheses Optional** ->  You can define tuples with or without parentheses, but using parentheses is recommended for clarity, especially in complex expressions.
- **Trailing Comma Required** -> When creating a tuple with **a single element**, a trailing comma is required—otherwise, it’s interpreted as a regular value.

```python
t = (1, "a", True)
t[0] = 0  TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

t1 = (1, [2, 3], True)
t1[1][0] = 3
print(t1) # Output:(1, [3, 3], True)

t2 = (1)
print(type(t2)) # Output: <class 'int'>

t3 = (1,)
print(type(t3)) # Output: <class 'tuple'>

```


## 📌 Defining a Tuple
Tuples are defined using **parentheses `()`**, and elements are separated by commas.

| Method | Example | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Empty Tuple** | `t1 = ()` | `()` |
| **Single-element tuple (comma is required)** | `t2 = (1,)` | `(1,)` |
| **Mixed types** | `t3 = (1, "a", True)` | `(1, 'a', True)` |
| **Parentheses can be omitted** | `t4 = 4, 5, 6` | `(4, 5, 6)` |

## 🐶 Tuple Indexing and Slicing
Just like lists, **tuples support indexing and slicing** to access individual elements or extract sub-tuples.
**Slicing Syntax:**`tuple[start:end:step]`
- **start:** Starting index (inclusive, default 0).
- **end:** Ending index (exclusive, default is end of list).
- **step:** Step size (default 1 for normal slicing, -1 for reverse order).


### 1️⃣ Accessing Elements (Indexing)
```python
t = ("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

print(t[0])    # Output: 'a' (first element)
print(t[-1])   # Output: 'e' (last element)
```

### 2️⃣ Extracting a Sub-Tuple (Slicing)
```python
t = ("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

print(t[1:3])   # Output: ('b', 'c')  → elements from index 1 up to (but not including) 3
print(t[::2])   # Output: ('a', 'c', 'e') → every second element
```

## 🐯 Concatenation 
You can use the `+` operator to **merge two or more tuples**. This creates a **new tuple** containing all the elements from the originals.

```python
t1 = (1, 2)
t2 = (3, 4)

t3 = t1 + t2
print(t3)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## 🦁 Repetition
You can **repeat the contents of a tuple** using the `*` operator. This will creates a new tuple with the repeated pattern.
```python
t1 = (1, 2)

t4 = t1 * 3
print(t4)  # Output: (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
```

## 🐷 Unpacking
**Tuple unpacking** allows you to **assign elements of a tuple to multiple variables in a single line**. This is especially useful for clean and readable code when dealing with fixed-length sequences.
```python
a, b, c = (10, 20, 30)
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 10 20 30
```

## 🐨 Zip
The built-in **zip()** function pairs up corresponding elements from the **two lists into tuples**.
```python
keys = ['name', 'age', 'language']
values = ['Kai', 28, 'Python']
zipped = zip(keys, values)
print(zipped)  # <zip object at 0x100cc6200>
print(dict(zipped)) # {'name': 'Kai', 'age': 28, 'language': 'Python'}
print(list(zipped)) # [('name', 'Kai'), ('age', 28), ('language', 'Python')]
```


## 🐼 Common Methods
Tuples are immutable sequences in Python, but you can still **access, analyze, and manipulate** their content using built-in operations.

| Method | Description | Example<br>`t = (1, 2, 2, 3, 2)` | Output |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|
| `count(obj)` | Returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple. | `t.count(2)` | `3` |
| `index(obj)` | Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value.<br>Raises ValueError if the value is not found. | `t.index(2)` | `1` |

## 🐔 Example - unpacking for student information
```python
student = ("Kai", 20, "Computer Science")

# Unpack the tuple into separate variables
name, age, major = student

print(f"{name}'s major is {major}")  
# Output: Kai's major is Computer Science.
```

# ðŸš€ LLM Streaming Output with LangChain: Real-Time Responses in Action
Large Language Models (LLMs) typically respond **in bulk** â€” generating the full answer before returning it. But in real-world applications (like chatbots or storytelling assistants), this can lead to **poor responsiveness**.

**Streaming** allows the model to:
- **Think out loud** by returning content token-by-token
- **Improve perceived speed** by showing partial output early
- **Enhance user experience** with real-time interaction

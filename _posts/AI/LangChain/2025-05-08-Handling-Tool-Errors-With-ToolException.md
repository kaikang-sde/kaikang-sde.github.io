# 🚀 Handling Tool Errors with ToolException
When an intelligent agent (Agent) in LangChain calls external tools such as APIs, databases, or search engines, it must be prepared to deal with **unexpected runtime errors**.

Without proper handling, these issues can:
- Crash the program with unhandled exceptions
- Confuse users with raw stack traces
- Block recovery — no way to retry or fallback


## 📌 Common Tool Failure Scenarios

| Scenario                  | Example                                                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network error           | API timeout or connection reset                                |
| Authentication failure | Expired or invalid API key                                      |
| Bad input               | Malformed or unsupported query parameters                       |
| Resource limit          | API quota exceeded or rate-limited                              |



## 🛡️ Solution: `ToolException` for Robust Error Handling

LangChain provides a built-in mechanism called **`ToolException`**  
to catch and handle tool-related failures in a structured and recoverable way.

### ✅ Core Benefits

- **Standardized error format**  
- **Preserves context** like tool name and failure reason  
- **Enables intelligent fallback and retries**  
- **Improves user-facing responses** with friendly error messages

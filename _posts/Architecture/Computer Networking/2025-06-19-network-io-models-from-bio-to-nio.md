# 🚀 Network I/O Models - From BIO to NIO
In system-level programming, I/O operations generally include:

- **Disk I/O**: Interacting with physical storage
- **Network I/O**: Transmitting and receiving data through network sockets

This post focuses on **network I/O**, particularly how data flows from the socket to the user program.


## 🔄 Two Phases of I/O

Every I/O operation involves two main steps:

1. **Waiting for data to be ready** (e.g., waiting for network packets)
2. **Reading or writing the data**

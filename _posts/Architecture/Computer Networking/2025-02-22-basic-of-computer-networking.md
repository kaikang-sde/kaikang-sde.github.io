# OSI & TCP/IP Network Layer Models

In modern networking, the **layered architecture** is the foundation that makes the internet scalable, modular, and maintainable. 

## üìö OSI 7-Layer Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

| Layer                  | Description                               | Examples                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 7. Application         | End-user services                         | HTTP, FTP, DNS                    |
| 6. Presentation        | Encoding, encryption                      | SSL, JPEG, ASCII                  |
| 5. Session             | Session management                        | NetBIOS, RPC                      |
| 4. Transport           | End-to-end connections                    | TCP, UDP                          |
| 3. Network             | Logical addressing & routing              | IP, ICMP                          |
| 2. Data Link           | MAC addressing & framing                  | Ethernet, PPP                     |
| 1. Physical            | Bit-level transmission                    | Fiber, RJ45, Wireless             |


## üì¶ TCP/IP 4-Layer Model

| Layer             | Description                                                  | Examples |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 4. Application Layer | High-level protocols for communication between applications | HTTP, FTP, SMTP   |
| 3. Transport Layer   | Reliable/unreliable data transmission between hosts         | TCP, UDP          |
| 2. Internet Layer    | Routing and addressing across networks                      | IP, ICMP          |
| 1. Network Interface | Physical transmission of data (hardware & drivers)          | Ethernet, Wi-Fi   |

## ü§î Why Do We Need Layering?

Imagine you're designing a network **without layering**:

- Application developers must write **raw binary** to interface directly with the NIC (Network Interface Card)
- Every app must implement:
  - Packet formatting
  - Connection handling
  - Reliability (ACKs, retries)
  - Routing logic

This is highly **inefficient and error-prone**.

### ‚úÖ Layered Approach = Abstraction + Responsibility

> Think of it like **software architecture**: `Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí DAO`

| Analogy Component       | Network Role                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Controller               | Application Layer             |
| Service                  | Transport Layer               |
| DAO (Data Access Object) | Network & Physical Layers     |

Each layer follows **Single Responsibility Principle**, which aligns with:

- **High Cohesion**: Each layer focuses on its own task
- **Low Coupling**: Layers interact through defined interfaces, not internal details


## üß± Encapsulation: Like Russian Dolls

Each layer **wraps the previous one**, creating a **nested packet** structure:
![Networking Models](/assets/img/posts/architecture/SimpleNetworkPacketFormat.png)

This **modular design** enables:

- Protocol independence
- Simplified debugging
- Easier maintenance and upgrades


## üåê OSI vs. TCP/IP
Both models serve as frameworks for understanding how data flows across networks. While they differ in complexity and abstraction, **each has unique advantages**.


| Model       | Advantage                         | Use Case                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **OSI (7-layer)** | More granular, detailed design       | Deep network analysis, design |
| **TCP/IP (4-layer)** | Practical, widely adopted in real systems | Real-world internet protocols  |


### OSI 7-Layer Model: Theoretical Yet Precise

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) splits the networking stack into **7 distinct layers**, offering clarity and isolation of responsibilities.

#### Strengths:
- Better conceptual understanding for learning & design
- Clear separation of concerns (Session, Presentation Layers)
- Suitable for explaining **application-aware load balancing**


### TCP/IP 4-Layer Model: Pragmatic and Widely Used

TCP/IP condenses the OSI layers into 4 broader categories, reflecting real-world protocol stacks.

### Strengths:
- Easier to implement
- Better maps to actual internet protocols (IP, TCP, HTTP)
- Used in **SSL/TLS encryption**, **HTTPS**, and **DNS**


###  Real-World Examples

#### HTTPS = TCP/IP Model Extension

- In the **TCP/IP model**, HTTPS operates by inserting **SSL/TLS** between **HTTP** (Application Layer) and **TCP** (Transport Layer).
- This layered encryption works seamlessly thanks to TCP/IP‚Äôs simplicity.

```text
Application:   HTTP
‚Üì
Encryption:    TLS / SSL
‚Üì
Transport:     TCP
‚Üì
Network:       IP
```

#### Load Balancing Comparison

1Ô∏è‚É£. **L4 Load Balancing Example: LVS (IP-Level Forwarding), F5**

- Layer 4 load balancing works at the **Transport Layer** of the OSI/TCP-IP model, primarily using **IP address** and **port number** to route traffic.
  - A **virtual IP + port** combination is exposed to the public.
  - Incoming requests are forwarded to **real backend servers** based on IP and port rules.
- It **does not inspect or parse** the application-layer protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
- The load balancer **does not generate or modify actual traffic**.
- It acts purely as a dispatcher.


| Feature                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **High Performance**       | Because there's no protocol parsing, it handles high-throughput traffic efficiently. |
| **Low Resource Usage**     | Minimal memory and CPU consumption compared to Layer 7 load balancers. |
| **Protocol-Agnostic**      | Can handle any TCP/UDP-based protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, MySQL). |
| **Simple Dispatching Logic** | Only considers IP and port, which simplifies routing logic. |

```text
Client
‚Üì
Virtual IP + Port (handled by LVS or F5)
‚Üì
Forwarding Decision (based on L4 rules)
‚Üì
Real Server (IP + Port)
```

2Ô∏è‚É£. **Layer 7 Load Balancing Example: HAProxy & Nginx**
- Layer 7 load balancing operates at the **Application Layer** of the OSI model. It can inspect the content of each HTTP/HTTPS request and make decisions based on application-level data such as URL, headers, cookies, and user-agent.
- Uses a **virtual URL or hostname** to receive client requests.
- **Parses the application-layer protocol** (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS).
- Makes intelligent routing decisions based on:
  - URL paths
  - Query parameters
  - Cookies
  - User-Agent strings

| Feature                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Content-Based Routing**  | Routes traffic based on specific path, domain, or header values. |
| **Session Stickiness**     | Ensures requests from the same client are sent to the same backend server. |
| **SSL Termination**        | Can handle SSL decryption and forward plain HTTP internally. |
| **Health Checks**          | Monitors application-level health of backend services. |


**Use Cases:**
- Web applications needing routing based on different subdomains or paths  
  e.g., `/api/*` goes to service A, `/admin/*` goes to service B
- Microservice architectures
- Applications requiring **SSL offloading** and **application-level logging**

```text
Client
‚Üì
Virtual URL / Domain (handled by Nginx or HAProxy)
‚Üì
Routing Decision (based on L7 features)
‚Üì
Selected Backend Server
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Layer 7 load balancers consume more system resources but offer much more **flexibility and intelligence** in routing logic.


## üßµ Network Layers & Protocols
A **network layered model** organizes how data is transmitted from one computer to another in the form of "layers" ‚Äî just like how a package is processed from the sender to the receiver through various **delivery checkpoints**.


### Real-World Analogy: Sending Ice Cream to a Friend

üéÑ It's Christmas. Kai (in PA) wants to send a box of ice cream to Jojo (in VA), who lives with Ahsh.

- üì¶ **The box of ice cream** = Application data
- üè¢ **PA ‚Üí VA logistics center** = Network Layer (IP-based routing between hosts)
- üë¶ **Local delivery person (looks at name & phone)** = Transport Layer (TCP/UDP ‚Äî targets correct process)
- üë©‚Äçü¶∞ **Jojo in her shared apartment** = Application-level process

| Real-World Item         | Network Equivalent     |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| House in PA       | A Host (IP address)     |
| üë© Jojo / Ahsh (roommates) | Processes (Port numbers) |
| üì¶ Ice cream box         | Application data       |
| üöö Logistics center       | Network (IP routing)    |
| üßç Local delivery guy     | Transport layer (TCP)   |


**Sending a Packet (Data Flow: Top to Bottom)**
```text
[Application Layer]  ‚Äî Message
‚Üì
[Transport Layer]    ‚Äî Adds Port (Process Info)
‚Üì
[Network Layer]      ‚Äî Adds IP (Host Info)
‚Üì
[Data Link + Physical] ‚Äî Converts to bits and sends via NIC
```

**Receiving a Packet (Data Flow: Bottom to Top)**

```text
[Physical Layer]     ‚Äî Reads bits from wire
‚Üë
[Data Link Layer]    ‚Äî Frame checking (MAC)
‚Üë
[Network Layer]      ‚Äî IP check (Host address)
‚Üë
[Transport Layer]    ‚Äî Port check (Process address)
‚Üë
[Application Layer]  ‚Äî Final message consumed by app

```

### Layer Mapping

| **Role**                     | **OSI Model (7 Layers)**     | **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**     | **Typical Network Protocols**                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Application (User Space)**| 7. Application Layer             | 4. Application Layer                | HTTP, FTP, NFS                                |
|                             | 6. Presentation Layer            | *(Part of Application)*      | Telnet, SNMP                                  |
|                             | 5. Session Layer                 | *(Part of Application)*      | SMTP, DNS                                     |
| **Operating System (Kernel)**| 4. Transport Layer              | 3. Transport Layer                  | TCP, UDP                                      |
|                             | 3. Network Layer                 | 2. Internet Layer                   | IP, ICMP, ARP, RARP                           |
| **Network Devices & Drivers**| 2. Data Link Layer              | 1. Network Access Layer             | PPP, Ethernet                                 |
|                             | 1.Physical Layer                | *(Part of Network Access Layer)* | IEEE 802.1A, IEEE 802.2 ~ IEEE 802.11         |


### Network Layer/Host vs. Transport Layer/Process 

| Layer         | Who Talks to Who?       | Address Used | Error Checking |
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Network Layer | Host-to-Host (device)     | IP Address   | Header only    |
| Transport Layer | Process-to-Process (apps) | Port Number  | Header + Data  |

üí° Think of it this way:
- The **network layer** makes sure the package reaches the right **house**.
- The **transport layer** ensures the package goes to the right **roommate**.


### transport layer vs. network layer

| Layer           | What it Does                         | Real-World Analogy         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Network Layer (IP) | Finds the right host across the internet | From Beijing to Guangzhou (main delivery hub) |
| Transport Layer (TCP/UDP) | Finds the right process on the host | Final delivery to Bingbing, not Anna |

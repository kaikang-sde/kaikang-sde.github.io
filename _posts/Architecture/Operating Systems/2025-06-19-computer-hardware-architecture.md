# 🚀 Computer Hardware Architecture - The Five Core Components
A modern computer is composed of **five major components**, each playing a distinct role in the execution of programs and processing of data. Understanding this architecture is fundamental to both software and hardware engineering.


## 🧠 1. Control Unit (CU)

- The **Control Unit** is the "commander" of the system.
- It **directs the operations** of the processor and other components by interpreting instructions and sending control signals.

> **Analogy:** Like a person’s brain giving commands to the body — it decides **what to do**.


## 🧮 2. Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)

- The **ALU** is responsible for all **arithmetic operations** (addition, subtraction, etc.) and **logical operations** (AND, OR, NOT).
- It executes instructions received from the control unit.

> **CU + ALU = CPU**  
> These two components are usually combined into a single chip — the **Central Processing Unit**.

> **Analogy:** Like the part of the brain that solves “1 + 1 = 3” (oops 🤭 — should be 2).


## 💾 3. Memory 
Memory provides the computer with its **data retention capabilities**, including:

### Internal Memory (RAM)
- Volatile memory (data is lost on power-off)
- Temporary storage for executing programs

### External Memory (Storage)
- Non-volatile (data retained after shutdown)
- Examples: HDD, SSD, USB flash drives

> **Analogy:** Like short-term and long-term memory — RAM forgets when you sleep, hard drives remember everything.


## 🎮 4. Input Devices 

These allow users or external systems to **input data** into the computer.

### Common Input Devices:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Microphone
- Touchscreen
- Gamepad
- Handwriting pad

> **Analogy:** Eyes and ears — taking in information from the world.

## 🖥️ 5. Output Devices 

These let the computer **communicate results back** to users or external systems.

### Common Output Devices:
- Display/Monitor
- Speaker
- Printer
- Projector

> **Analogy (Kai):** Mouth — expressing thoughts or results.
